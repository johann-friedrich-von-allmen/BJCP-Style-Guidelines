Modern versions were first produced by Rheingold in 1967 to appeal to diet-conscious drinkers, but only became popular starting in 1973 after Miller Brewing acquired the recipe and marketed the beer heavily to sports fans with the \u201ctastes great, less filling\u201d campaign. Beers of this genre became the largest sellers in the United States in the 1990s.",

Low to mediumLow hop flavor of any variety, but typically floral, spicy, or herbal. Subtle.",

      "mouthfeel":"Medium body, with a smooth, somewhat creamy texture. Medium carbonation. Alcohol strength barely noticeable as warming, if at all.",
      "comments":"This style represents the modern German beer served at Oktoberfest (although it is not solely reserved for Oktoberfest; it can be found at many other \u2018fests\u2019), and is sometimes called Wiesn (\u201cthe meadow\u201d or local name for the Oktoberfest festival). We chose to call this style Festbier since by German and EU regulations, Oktoberfestbier is a protected appellation for beer produced at large breweries within the Munich city limits for consumption at Oktoberfest. Other countries are not bound by these rules, so many craft breweries in the US produce beer called Oktoberfest, but based on the traditional style described in these guidelines as M\u00e4rzen. May be called Helles M\u00e4rzen.",
      "history":"Since 1990, the majority of beer served at Oktoberfest in Munich has been this style. Export beer specifically made for the United States is still mainly of the traditional amber style, as are US-produced interpretations. Paulaner first created the golden version in the mid-1970s because they thought the traditional Oktoberfest was too filling. So they developed a lighter, more drinkable but still malty version that they wanted to be \u201cmore poundable\u201d (according to the head brewer at Paulaner). But the actual type of beer served at Oktoberfest is set by a Munich city committee.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Majority Pils malt, but with some Vienna or Munich malt to increase maltiness. Differences in commercial examples are mostly due to different maltsters and yeast, not major grist differences.",
      "styleComparison":"Less intense and less richly toasted than a M\u00e4rzen. Stronger than a Munich Helles, with a bit more body, and hop and malt flavor. Less rich in malt intensity than a Helles Bock. The malt complexity is similar to a higher-gravity Czech Premium Pale Lager, although without the associated hops.",

K\u00f6ln breweries differentiate themselves through balance, so allow for a range of variation within the style when judging. Drier versions may seem hoppier or more bitter than the IBU levels might suggest. The delicate flavor profile does not age well, so be alert for oxidation defects. Served in K\u00f6ln in a tall, narrow 20cl glass called a Stange.",
      "history":"K\u00f6ln has a top-fermenting brewing tradition since the Middle Ages, but the beer now known as K\u00f6lsch was developed in the late 1800s as an alternative to pale lagers. Bottom fermentation was actually prohibited in Cologne. K\u00f6lsch is an appellation protected by the K\u00f6lsch Konvention (1986), and is restricted to breweries in and around K\u00f6ln.

Pils found in Bavaria tend to be a bit softer in bitterness with more malt flavor and late hop character, yet still with sufficient hops and crispness of finish to differentiate itself from Munich Helles. The use of the term \u2018Pils\u2019 is more common in Germany than \u2018Pilsner\u2019 to differentiate it from the Czech style, and (some say) to show respect.",

      "overallImpression":"An amber, malty German lager with a clean, rich, toasty, bready malt flavor, restrained bitterness, and a well-attenuated finish. The overall malt impression is soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich malty aftertaste that is never cloying or heavy.",
      "aroma":"Moderate malty aroma, typically rich, bready, somewhat toasty, with light bread crust notes. Clean lager fermentation character. Very low floral, herbal, or spicy hop aroma optional. Caramel-sweet, biscuity-dry, or roasted malt aromas are inappropriate. Very light alcohol might be detected, but should never be sharp. Clean, elegant malt richness should be the primary aroma.",
      "appearance":"Amber-orange to deep reddish-copper color; should not be golden. Bright clarity, with persistent, off-white foam stand.",
      "flavor":"Moderate to high rich malt flavor often initially suggests sweetness, but the finish is moderately-dry to dry. Distinctive and complex maltiness often includes a bready, toasty aspect. Hop bitterness is moderate, and the floral, herbal, or spicy hop flavor is low to none. Hops provide sufficient balance that the malty palate and finish do not seem sweet. The aftertaste is malty, with the same elegant, rich malt flavors lingering. Noticeable sweet caramel, dry biscuit, or roasted flavors are inappropriate. Clean fermentation profile.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium body, with a smooth, creamy texture that often suggests a fuller mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Fully attenuated, without a sweet or cloying impression. May be slightly warming, but the strength should be relatively hidden.",
      "comments":"Modern domestic German Oktoberfest versions are golden \u2013 see the Festbier style for this version. Export German versions (to the United States, at least) are typically orange-amber in color, have a distinctive toasty malt character, and are often labeled Oktoberfest. Many craft versions of Oktoberfest are based on this style. Historic versions of the beer tended to be darker, towards the brown color range, but there have been many \u2018shades\u2019 of M\u00e4rzen (when the name is used as a strength); this style description specifically refers to the stronger amber lager version. The modern Festbier can be thought of as a lighter-bodied, pale M\u00e4rzen by these terms.",
      "history":"As the name suggests, brewed as a stronger \u201cMarch beer\u201d in March and lagered in cold caves over the summer. Modern versions trace back to the lager developed by Spaten in 1841, contemporaneous to the development of Vienna lager. However, the M\u00e4rzen name is much older than 1841 \u2013 the early ones were dark brown, and the name implied a strength band (14 \u00b0P) rather than a style. The amber lager style served at Oktoberfest from 1872 until 1990 when the golden Festbier was adopted as the standard festival beer.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Grist varies, although traditional German versions emphasized Munich malt. The notion of elegance is derived from the finest quality ingredients, particularly the base malts. A decoction mash is traditional, and enhances the rich malt profile.",
      "styleComparison":"Not as strong and rich as a Dunkles Bock. More malt depth and richness than a Festbier, with a heavier body and slightly less hops. Less hoppy but equally malty as a Czech Amber Lager, but with a different malt profile.",

      "aroma":"Blend of smoke and malt, varying in balance and intensity. The beechwood smoke character can range from subtle to fairly strong, and can seem smoky, woody, or bacon-like. The malt character can be low to moderate, and be somewhat rich, toasty, or malty-sweet. The malt and smoke components are often inversely proportional (i.e., when smoke increases, malt decreases, and vice versa). Low floral or spicy hop aroma optional. Clean fermentation profile.",
      "appearance":"Very clear, with a large, creamy, rich, tan- to cream-colored head. Deep amber to coppery-brown in color, often a little darker than the underlying M\u00e4rzen style.",
      "flavor":"Generally follows the aroma profile, with a blend of smoke and malt in varying balance and intensity, yet always mutually supportive. M\u00e4rzen-like qualities should be evident, particularly a malty, toasty richness, but the beechwood smoke flavor can be low to high. The palate can be somewhat malty, rich, and sweet, yet the finish tends to be medium-dry to dry with the smoke character sometimes enhancing the dryness of the finish. The aftertaste can reflect both malt richness and smoke flavors, with a balanced presentation desirable. Moderate, balanced, hop bitterness. Can have up to a moderate hop flavor with spicy, floral, or herbal notes. Clean lager fermentation character.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium body. Medium to mediumHigh carbonation. Smooth lager character. Significant astringent, phenolic harshness is inappropriate.",
      "comments":"Literally smoke beer in German. The smoke character and intensity varies by maltster and brewery, so allow for variation in the style when judging \u2013 not all examples are highly smoked. Many other traditional German styles are smoked; those should be entered in the 32A Classic Style Smoked Beer style. This style is only for the more common M\u00e4rzen-based beer.",
      "history":"A historical specialty of the city of Bamberg, in the Franconian region of Bavaria in Germany. While smoked beers certainly were made long ago, the origins of this specific style are unclear but must have been developed after M\u00e4rzen was created.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"M\u00e4rzen-type grist, with the addition of a sizeable quantity of German Rauchmalz (beechwood-smoked Vienna-type malt). Some breweries smoke their own malt. German lager yeast. Traditional German or Czech hops.",

      "overallImpression":"A moderately colored, well-attenuated, bitter beer with a rich maltiness balancing a strong bitterness. Light and spicy hop character complements the malt. A dry beer with a firm body and smooth palate.",
      "aroma":"Malty and rich with grainy characteristics like baked bread or nutty, toasted bread crusts. Should not have darker roasted or chocolate notes. Malt intensity is moderate to moderatelyHigh. Moderate to low hops complement but do not dominate the malt, and often have a spicy, peppery, or floral character. Fermentation character is very clean. Low to mediumLow esters optional.",
      "appearance":"The color ranges from amber to deep copper, stopping short of brown; bronze-orange is most common. Brilliant clarity. Thick, creamy, long-lasting off-white head.",
      "flavor":"Malt profile similar to the aroma, with an assertive, medium to high hop bitterness balancing the rich malty flavors. The beer finishes medium-dry to dry with a grainy, bitter, malty-rich aftertaste. The finish is long-lasting, sometimes with a nutty or bittersweet impression. The apparent bitterness level is sometimes masked by the malt character if the beer is not very dry, but the bitterness tends to scale with the malt richness to maintain balance. No roast. No harshness. Clean fermentation profile. Light fruity esters, especially dark fruit, may be present. Medium to low spicy, peppery, or floral hop flavor. Light minerally character optional.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium body. Smooth. Medium to mediumHigh carbonation. Astringency low to none.",
      "comments":"Classic, traditional examples in the Altstadt (\u201cold town\u201d) section of D\u00fcsseldorf are served from casks. Most examples have a balanced (25-35 IBU) bitterness, not the aggressive hop character of the well-known Zum Uerige. Stronger sticke and doppelsticke beers should be entered in the 27 Historical Beer style instead.",
      "history":"Developed in the late 19th century in D\u00fcsseldorf to use lager techniques to compete with lager. Older German styles were brewed in the area but there is no linkage to modern Altbier.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Grists vary, but usually consist of German base malts (usually Pils, sometimes Munich) with small amounts of crystal, chocolate, or black malts. May include some wheat, including roasted wheat. Spalt hops are traditional, but other traditional German or Czech hops can be used. Clean, highly attenuative ale yeast. A step mash program is traditional. Fermented at cool ale temperatures, then cold conditioned.",
      "styleComparison":"More bitter and malty than International Amber Lagers. Somewhat similar to California Common, both in production technique and finished flavor and color, though not in ingredients. Less alcohol, less malty richness, and more bitterness than a Dunkles Bock. Drier, richer, and more bitter than a Vienna Lager.",

      "overallImpression":"A strong, full-bodied, rich, and malty dark German lager often with a viscous quality and strong flavors. Even though flavors are concentrated, the alcohol should be smooth and warming, not burning.",
      "aroma":"Dominated by rich, intense malt and a definite alcohol presence. The malt can have bready, toasty, qualities, with some caramel or faint chocolate, often with dark fruit notes like plums or grapes. No hop aroma. Alcohol aromas should not be harsh or solventy. Clean fermentation profile.",
      "appearance":"Deep copper to dark brown in color, often with attractive ruby highlights. Good clarity. Head retention may be moderate to poor. Off-white to deep ivory colored head. Pronounced legs are often evident.",
      "flavor":"Rich, sweet malt balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The malt can have Maillard products, toasty qualities, some caramel, and occasionally a slight chocolate flavor. May have significant malt-derived dark fruit esters. Hop bitterness just offsets the malt sweetness enough to avoid a cloying character. No hop flavor. Alcohol helps balance the strong malt presence. The finish should be of rich malt with a certain dryness from the alcohol. It should not be sticky, syrupy, or cloyingly sweet. Clean fermentation profile.",
      "mouthfeel":"Full to very full-bodied. Low carbonation. Significant alcohol warmth without sharp hotness. Very smooth and silky without harsh edges from alcohol, bitterness, fusels, or other concentrated flavors.",
      "comments":"Extended lagering is often needed post-freezing to smooth the alcohol and enhance the malt and alcohol balance. Pronounced \u201cICE-bock.\u201d",
      "history":"Originating in Kulmbach in Franconia in the late 1800s, although exact origins are not known. Fables describe it as coming from beer accidentally freezing at a brewery.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Same as Doppelbock. Produced by freezing a doppelbock-like beer and removing ice (\u201cfreeze distillation\u201d), thus concentrating flavor and alcohol, as well as any defects present. Commercial eisbocks are generally concentrated anywhere from 7% to 33% by volume.",
      "styleComparison":"Eisbocks are not simply stronger Doppelbocks; the name refers to the process of freezing and concentrating the beer, and is not a statement on alcohol; some Doppelbocks are stronger than Eisbocks. Not as thick, rich, or sweet as a Wheatwine.",

      "aroma":"Rich maltiness often containing caramel, toffee, nuts, deep toast, or licorice notes. Complex alcohol and ester profile of moderate strength, and reminiscent of plums, prunes, raisins, cherries, or currants, occasionally with a vinous Port-like quality. Deep malt accents of dark chocolate, coffee, or molasses, but never burnt. No hops. No sourness. Smooth, not sharp, impression.",
      "appearance":"Dark reddish-copper to opaque dark brown color, but not black. Thick, persistent tan-colored head. Clear, although darker versions can be opaque.",
      "flavor":"As with aroma, has a rich maltiness with a complex blend of deep malt, dried fruit esters, and alcohol. The malt can have a caramel, toffee, nutty, molasses, or licorice complexity. Prominent yet smooth Schwarzbier-like roasted flavor that stops short of burnt. Light hints of black currants and dark dried fruits. Smooth palate and full finish. Starts malty-sweet but darker malt flavors quickly dominate and persist through the dryish finish, leaving a hint of roast coffee or licorice and dried fruit in the aftertaste. MediumLow to medium bitterness, just to provide balance and prevent it from seeming cloying. Hop flavor from slightly spicy hops ranges from none to mediumLow. Clean fermentation profile.",
      "mouthfeel":"Generally quite full-bodied and smooth, with a well-aged alcohol warmth that can be deceptive. Medium to mediumHigh carbonation, making it seem even more mouth-filling. Not heavy on the tongue due to carbonation level.",
      "comments":"Most commercial versions are in the 7\u20138.5% ABV range. The best examples have a deceptive strength that makes them dangerously easy to drink. The character of these beers varies by country of origin, so be careful about generalizing based on a single example. Some beers are truer to their English roots, while others are more of the style first popularized in Poland.",
      "history":"Developed indigenously (and independently) in several countries bordering the Baltic Sea after import of popular English porters and stouts was interrupted in the early 1800s. Historically top-fermented, many breweries adapted the recipes for bottom-fermenting yeast along with the rest of their production. The name Baltic Porter is recent (since the 1990s) and describes the modern collection of beers with a somewhat similar profile from these countries, not historical versions.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Generally lager yeast (cold fermented if using ale yeast, as is required when brewed in Russia). Debittered dark malt. Munich or Vienna base malt. Continental hops. May contain crystal malts or adjuncts. Brown or amber malt common in historical recipes. As a collection of regional beers, different formulations are expected.",
      "styleComparison":"Combines the body, maltiness, richness, and smoothness of a Doppelbock, the darker malt character of an English Porter, the roast flavors of a Schwarzbier, and alcohol and fruitiness of and Old Ale. Much less roasted and often lower in alcohol than an Imperial Stout.",

Light vanilla optional. Light floral, spicy, or herbal hops optional. Bubblegum (strawberry with banana), sourness, or smoke are faults.",

Low to moderate soft, somewhat bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavor supported by the slight Pils malt grainy sweetness. Very low to moderately low bitterness. Well-rounded, flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish. Light vanilla optional. Very low floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor optional. Any impression of sweetness is due more to low bitterness than any residual sweetness; a sweet or heavy finish impairs drinkability. Bubblegum, sourness, or smoke are faults. While the banana-and-clove profile is important, it should not be so strong as to be extreme and unbalanced.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium-light to medium body; never heavy. Fluffy, creamy fullness progressing to a light, spritzy finish aided by high to very high carbonation. Effervescent.",
      "comments":"Also known as hefeweizen or weizenbier, particularly outside Bavaria. These beers are best enjoyed while young and fresh, as they often don\u2019t age well. In Germany, lower-alcohol light (leicht) and non-alcoholic versions are popular. Kristall versions are filtered for brilliant clarity.",
      "history":"While Bavaria has a wheat beer tradition dating back before the 1500s, brewing wheat beer used to be a monopoly reserved for Bavarian royalty. Modern Weissbier dates from 1872 when Schneider began production of its amber version. However, pale Weissbier only became popular since the 1960s (although the name historically could be used in Germany to describe beer made from air-dried malt, a different tradition).

      "overallImpression":"A strong and malty German wheat beer combining the best wheat and yeast flavors of a Weissbier with the rich maltiness, strength, and body of a Bock. The style range includes Bock and Doppelbock strength, with variations for pale and dark color.",
      "aroma":"MediumHigh to high malty richness with a significant bready, grainy wheat character. MediumLow to mediumHigh weizen yeast character, typically banana and clove. Vanilla accents optional. No hops. Low to moderate alcohol, not hot or solventy. The malt, yeast, and alcohol are well balanced, complex, and inviting. Bubblegum (strawberry with banana), sourness, or smoke are faults.",
      "appearance":"Very thick, moussy, long-lasting head. Can be hazy and have a shine from wheat and yeast, although this can settle out with age.",
      "flavor":"MediumHigh to high malty richness with significant bready, grainy wheat flavor. Low to moderate banana and spice (clove, vanilla) yeast character. No hop flavor. Low to mediumLow bitterness can give a slightly sweet palate impression, but the beer typically finishes dry. Light alcohol can enhance this character. The interplay between the malt, yeast, and alcohol adds complexity and interest, which is often enhanced with age. Bubblegum, sourness, or smoke are faults.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium-full to full body. Soft, smooth, fluffy or creamy texture. Mild alcohol warmth. Moderate to high carbonation.",
      "comments":"A Weissbier brewed to bock or doppelbock strength, although Schneider also produces an Eisbock version. Pale and dark versions exist, but dark is most common. Lightly oxidized Maillard products can produce some rich, intense flavors and aromas that are often seen in aged imported commercial products; fresher versions will not have this character. Well-aged examples might also take on a slight sherry-like complexity. Pale versions, like their doppelbock cousins, have less rich malt complexity and often more hop-forward. However, versions that have significant late hops or are dry-hopped should be entered in 34B Mixed-Style Beer.",
      "history":"Dopplebock-strength Aventinus was created in 1907 at the Schneider Weisse Brauhaus in Munich. Pale versions are a much more recent invention.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Malted wheat, at least half the grist. Munich, Vienna, or Pilsner malt. Color malts may be used sparingly. Decoction mash traditional. Weizen yeast, cool fermentation temperatures.",
      "styleComparison":"Stronger and richer than a Weissbier or Dunkles Weissbier, but with similar yeast character. More directly comparable to the Doppelbock style, with the pale and dark variations. Can vary widely in strength, but most are in the Bock to Doppelbock range.",

It is a unique (but very well-known) beer that has a very strong, complex malt profile not found in other examples, often leading judges to overly penalize traditional English strong bitters. In America, ESB has been co-opted to describe a malty, bitter, reddish, standard-strength (for the US) British-type ale, and is a popular craft beer style. This may cause some judges to think of US brewpub ESBs as representative of this style.",

Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily \u201cmore premium\u201d since best bitters are traditionally the brewer\u2019s finest product).

      "aroma":"Hop aroma is moderately low to moderately high, and can use any variety of hops \u2013 floral, herbal, or earthy English hops and citrusy American hops are most common. Frequently a single hop varietal will be showcased. Low bready malt aroma with no caramel. MediumLow to low fruity aroma from the hops rather than esters. Low diacetyl optional.",
      "appearance":"Straw to golden in color. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white head. A low head is acceptable when carbonation is also low.",
      "flavor":"Medium to mediumHigh bitterness. Hop flavor is moderate to moderately high of any hop variety, although citrus flavors are increasingly common. MediumLow to low malt character, generally bready with perhaps a little biscuity flavor. Caramel flavors are typically absent. Hop bitterness and flavor should be pronounced. ModeratelyLow to low esters. Medium-dry to dry finish. Bitterness increases with alcohol level, but is always balanced. Low diacetyl optional.",
      "mouthfeel":"Light to medium body. Low to moderate carbonation on draught, although bottled commercial versions will be higher. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth, but this character should not be too high.",
      "comments":"Well-hopped, quenching beer with an emphasis on showcasing hops. Served colder than traditional bitters, this style was originally positioned as a refreshing summer beer, but is now often brewed year-round. Once brewed with English hops, increasingly American citrus-flavored hops are used. Golden Ales are also called Golden Bitters, Summer Ales, or British Blonde Ales. Can be found in cask, keg, and bottle.",
      "history":"Modern golden ales were developed in England to take on strongly-marketed lagers. While it is difficult to identify the first, Hop Back's Summer Lightning, first brewed in 1986, is thought by many to have got the style off the ground.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Low-color pale or lager malt acting as a blank canvas for the hop character. May use sugar adjuncts, corn, or wheat. English hops frequently used, although citrusy American varietals are becoming more common. Somewhat clean-fermenting British yeast.",
      "styleComparison":"More similar to an American Pale Ale than anything else, although it is often lower in alcohol and usually features British ingredients. Has no caramel and fewer esters compared to British Bitters and pale ales. Dry as Bitters but with less malt character to support the hops, giving a different balance. Often uses (and features) American hops, more so than most other modern British styles. Balance of hoppiness between a Blonde Ale and an American Pale Ale.",

      "aroma":"Fairly soft, clean aroma with a balanced mix of esters, hops, malt, and yeast \u2013 all moderate to low in intensity. The esters are frequently pears and apples, optionally with a very light touch of banana. The hops are earthy, herbaceous, or might show the characteristic iron-like Pride of Ringwood nose. The malt can range from neutral grainy to moderately sweet to lightly bready; no caramel should be evident. Very fresh examples can have a lightly yeasty, sulfury nose.",
      "appearance":"Deep yellow to light amber in color, often medium gold. Tall, frothy, persistent white head with tiny bubbles. Noticeable effervescence due to high carbonation. Brilliant clarity if decanted, but typically poured with yeast to have a cloudy appearance. Not typically cloudy unless yeast roused during the pour.",
      "flavor":"Medium to low rounded, grainy to bready malt flavor, initially mild to malty-sweet but a medium to mediumHigh bitterness rises mid-palate to balance the malt. Caramel flavors typically absent. Highly attenuated, giving a dry, crisp finish with lingering bitterness, although the body gives an impression of fullness. Medium to mediumHigh hop flavor, somewhat earthy and possibly herbal, resinous, peppery, or iron-like but not floral, lasting into aftertaste. MediumHigh to mediumLow esters, often pears and apples. Banana is optional, but should never dominate. May be lightly minerally or sulfury, especially if yeast is present. Should not be bland.",
      "mouthfeel":"High to very high carbonation, giving mouth-filling bubbles and a crisp, spritzy carbonic bite. Medium to medium-full body, tending to the higher side if poured with yeast. Smooth but gassy. Stronger versions may have a light alcohol warmth, but lower alcohol versions will not. Very well-attenuated; should not have any residual sweetness.",
      "comments":"Coopers has been making their flagship Sparkling Ale since 1862, although the formulation has changed over the years. Presently the beer will have brilliant clarity if decanted, but publicans often pour most of the beer into a glass then swirl the bottle and dump in all the yeast. In some bars, the bottle is rolled along the bar. When served on draught, the brewery instructs publicans to invert the keg to rouse the yeast. A cloudy appearance for the style seems to be a modern consumer preference. Always naturally carbonated, even in the keg. A present-use ale, best enjoyed fresh.",
      "history":"Brewing records show that the majority of Australian beer brewed in the 19th century was draught XXX (Mild) and porter. Ale in bottle was originally developed to compete with imported bottled pale ales from British breweries, such as Bass and Wm Younger\u2019 Monk. By the early 20th century, bottled pale ale went out of fashion and \u201clighter\u201d lager beers were in vogue. Many Australian Sparkling and Pale Ales were labeled as ales, but were actually bottom-fermented lagers with very similar grists to the ales that they replaced. Coopers of Adelaide, South Australia is the only surviving brewer producing the Sparkling Ale style.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Lightly kilned Australian 2-row pale malt, lager varieties may be used. Small amounts of crystal malt for color adjustment only. Modern examples use no adjuncts, cane sugar for priming only. Historical examples using 45% 2 row, 30% higher protein malt (6 row) would use around 25% sugar to dilute the nitrogen content. Traditionally used Australian hops, Cluster, and Goldings until replaced from mid-1960s by Pride of Ringwood. Highly attenuative Burton-type yeast (Australian-type strain typical). Variable water profile, typically with low carbonate and moderate sulfate.",
      "styleComparison":"Superficially similar to English Pale Ales, although much more highly carbonated, with less caramel, less late hops, and showcasing the signature yeast strain and hop variety. More bitter than IBUs might suggest due to high attenuation, low final gravity, and somewhat coarse hops.",

Finish is medium-dry to very dry, and the bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. The balance is toward the hops, but the malt should still be noticeable in support. If high sulfate water is used, a distinctively minerally, dry finish, some sulfur flavor, and a lingering bitterness are usually present. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions.",
      "mouthfeel":"Smooth, medium-light to medium body without hop-derived astringency. Medium to mediumHigh carbonation can give an overall dry sensation despite a supportive malt presence. A low, smooth alcohol warming can be sensed in stronger versions.",
      "comments":"The attributes of IPA that were important to its arrival in good condition in India were that it was very well-attenuated, and heavily hopped. Simply because this is how IPA was shipped, doesn\u2019t mean that other beers such as Porter weren\u2019t also sent to India, that IPA was invented to be sent to India, that IPA was more heavily hopped than other keeping beers, or that the alcohol level was unusual for the time.",
      "history":"Originally a pale stock ale from London that was first shipped to India in the late 1700s. George Hodgson of the Bow Brewery did not create the style, but was the first well known brewer to dominate the market. After a trade dispute, the East India Company had Samuel Allsopp recreate (and reformulate) the beer in 1823 using Burton\u2019s sulfate-rich water. The name India Pale Ale wasn\u2019t used until around 1830.",

Moderate fruity esters optional. Low hop flavor optional. Low diacetyl optional.",
      "mouthfeel":"Light to medium body. Generally low to mediumLow carbonation. Roast-based versions may have a light astringency. Sweeter versions may seem to have a rather full mouthfeel for the gravity. Should not be flat, watery, or thin.",
      "comments":"Most are low-gravity session beers around 3.2%, although some versions may be made in the stronger (4%+) range for export, festivals, seasonal or special occasions. Generally served on cask; session-strength bottled versions don\u2019t often travel well. A wide range of interpretations are possible. Pale (medium amber to light brown) versions exist, but these are even more rare than dark milds; these guidelines only describe the modern dark version.",
      "history":"Historically, \u2018mild\u2019 was simply an unaged beer, and could be used as an adjective to distinguish between aged or more highly hopped keeping beers. Modern milds trace their roots to the weaker X-type ales of the 1800s, which started to get darker in the 1880s, but only after WWI did they become dark brown. In current usage, the term implies a lower-strength beer with less hop bitterness than bitters. The guidelines describe the modern British version. The term \u2018mild\u2019 is currently somewhat out of favor with consumers, and many breweries no longer use it. Increasingly rare. There is no historic connection or relationship between Mild and Porter.",

      "appearance":"Dark amber to dark reddish-brown color. Clear. Low to moderate off-white to light tan head.",
      "flavor":"Gentle to moderate malt sweetness, with a light to heavy caramel character, and a medium to dry finish. Malt may also have a nutty, toasted, biscuity, toffee, or light chocolate character. Medium to mediumLow bitterness. Malt-hop balance ranges from even to malt-focused. Low floral or earthy hop flavor optional. Low to moderate fruity esters optional.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium-light to medium body. Medium to mediumHigh carbonation.",
      "comments":"A wide-ranging category with different interpretations possible, ranging from lighter-colored to hoppy to deeper, darker, and caramel-focused; however, none of the versions have strongly roasted flavors. A stronger Double Brown Ale was more popular in the past, but is very hard to find now. While London Brown Ales are marketed using the name Brown Ale, we list those as a different judging style due to the significant difference in balance (especially sweetness) and alcohol strength; that doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t in the same family, though.",
      "history":"Brown ale has a long history in Great Britain, although different products used that name at various times. Modern brown ale is a 20th century creation; it is not the same as historical products with the same name. A wide range of gravities were brewed, but modern brown ales are generally of the stronger (by current UK standards) interpretation. This style is based on the modern stronger British brown ales, not historical versions or the sweeter London Brown Ale described in the Historical Beer category. Predominantly but not exclusively a bottled product currently.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"British mild ale or pale ale malt base with caramel malts. May also have small amounts darker malts (e.g., chocolate) to provide color and the nutty character. English hop varieties are most authentic.",
      "styleComparison":"More malty balance than British Bitters, with more malt flavors from darker grains. Stronger than a Dark Mild. Less roast than an English Porter. Stronger and much less sweet than London Brown Ale.",

Should not be burnt or harshly roasted, although small amounts may contribute a bitter chocolate complexity. Up to moderate earthy or floral hop flavor optional. Low to moderate fruity esters. MediumLow to medium bitterness varies the balance from slightly malty to slightly bitter, with a fairly dry to slightly sweet finish. ModeratelyLow diacetyl optional.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium-light to medium body. ModeratelyLow to moderatelyHigh carbonation. Light to moderate creamy texture.",
      "comments":"This style description describes the modern version of English Porter, not every possible variation over time in every region where it existed. Historical re-creations should be entered in the 27 Historical Beer category, with an appropriate description describing the profile of the beer. Modern craft examples in the UK are bigger and hoppier.",
      "history":"Originating in London in the early 1700s, porter evolved as a more heavily hopped and aged (keeping) version of the Brown Beer popular at the time. It evolved many times based on various technological and ingredient developments (such as the invention of black malt in 1817, and large-scale industrial brewing), as well as consumer preferences, wars, and tax policy. It became a highly-popular, widely-exported style in the early 1800s before declining by the 1870s as it changed to a lower gravity, unaged beer. As gravities continued to decline in all UK beers in the first half of the 1900s, styles stopped being made (including porter, gone by the 1950s). The craft beer era led to its re-introduction in 1978.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Grists vary, but something producing a dark color is always involved. Chocolate or other roasted malts, caramel malt, brewing sugars, and the like are common. London-type porters often use brown malt as a characteristic flavor.",
      "styleComparison":"Differs from American Porter in that it usually has softer, sweeter, and more caramelly flavors, lower gravities, and usually less alcohol; American Porter also usually has more hop character. More substance and roast than a British Brown Ale. Higher in gravity than a Dark Mild.",

      "comments":"The style is fairly broad to allow for examples beyond the traditional ones from Ireland. Irish examples tend to be lower alcohol, grainier, and drier in the finish, while non-Irish versions are often higher in alcohol, sweeter, perhaps more caramelly and estery, and are often seasonal offerings.",
      "history":"While Ireland has a long ale brewing heritage, the modern Irish Red Ale style is essentially an adaptation or interpretation of the popular English Bitter style with less hopping and a bit of roast to add color and dryness, although some suggest a longer history. Rediscovered as a craft beer style in Ireland, today it is an essential part of most brewery lineups, along with a pale ale and a stout.",

      "mouthfeel":"Medium-light to medium-full body, with a somewhat creamy character \u2013 especially when served by nitro pour. Low to moderate carbonation. For the high hop bitterness and significant proportion of dark grains present, this beer is remarkably smooth. May have a light astringency from the roasted grains, although harshness is undesirable.",
      "comments":"Traditionally a draught product. Modern examples are almost always associated with a nitro pour. Do not expect bottled beers to have the full, creamy texture or very long-lasting head associated with mixed-gas dispense. Regional differences exist in Ireland, similar to variability in English Bitters. Dublin-type stouts use roasted barley, are more bitter, and are drier. Cork-type stouts are sweeter, less bitter, and have flavors from chocolate and specialty malts.",
      "history":"The style evolved from London porters, but reflecting a fuller, creamier, more \u201cstout\u201d body and strength. Guinness began brewing only porter in 1799, and a \u201cstouter kind of porter\u201d around 1810. Irish stout diverged from London single stout (or simply porter) in the late 1800s, with an emphasis on darker malts and roast barley. Guinness began using flaked barley after WWII, and Guinness Draught was launched as a brand in 1959. Draught (\u201cwidget\u201d) cans and bottles were developed in the late 1980s and 1990s.",

Historically known as \u201cMilk\u201d or \u201cCream\u201d stouts, legally this designation is no longer permitted in England but may be acceptable elsewhere.

Most popular in England between the World Wars, was revived in the craft beer era for export, which helped lead to its adoption as a popular modern American craft beer style that uses a noticeable (not symbolic) quantity of oats.",

Some alcohol and nutty oxidative notes are acceptable, akin to those found in Sherry, Port, or Madeira. Hop aroma not usually present.",
      "appearance":"Deep amber to very dark reddish-brown color, but most are fairly dark. Age and oxidation may darken the beer further. Clear, but can be almost opaque. Moderate to low cream- to light tan-colored head; retention average to poor.",
      "flavor":"Medium to high malt character with a luscious malt complexity, often with nut, caramel, or molasses-like flavors. Light chocolate or roasted malt flavors are optional, but should never be prominent. Balance is often malty-sweet, but may be well hopped; the impression of bitterness often depends on amount of aging. Moderate to high fruity esters are common, and may take on a dried-fruit or vinous character. The finish may vary from dry to somewhat sweet. Extended aging may contribute oxidative flavors similar to a fine old Sherry, Port, or Madeira. Alcoholic strength should be evident, though not overwhelming. Low diacetyl optional.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium to full, chewy body, although older examples may be lower in body due to continued attenuation during conditioning. Alcohol warmth is often evident and always welcome. Low to moderate carbonation, depending on age and conditioning. Light acidity may be present, as well as some tannin if wood-aged; both are optional.",
      "comments":"Strength and character vary widely. The predominant defining quality for this style is the impression of age, which can manifest itself in different ways (complexity, oxidation, leather, vinous qualities, etc.). Many of these qualities are otherwise faults, but if the resulting character of the beer is pleasantly drinkable and complex, then those characteristics are acceptable. In no way should those allowable characteristics be interpreted as making an undrinkably off-flavored beer as somehow in style. Old Peculier is a well-known but fairly unique beer that is quite different than other Old Ales.",
      "history":"Historically, an aged ale used as stock ales for blending or enjoyed at full strength (stale or stock refers to beers that were aged or stored for a significant period of time). There are at least two definite types in Britain today, weaker, unaged draught ones that are similar to milds of around 4.5%, and stronger aged ones that are often 6-8% or more.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Composition varies, although generally similar to British Strong Ales. The age character is the biggest driver of the final style profile, which is more handling than brewing.",
      "styleComparison":"Roughly overlapping the British Strong Ale and the lower end of the English Barley Wine styles, but always having an aged quality. The distinction between an Old Ale and a Barley Wine is somewhat arbitrary above 7% ABV, and generally means having a more significant aged quality.",

When aged, these fruity components come out more, and darker versions will have a higher level than paler ones. The hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness can vary wildly. Light to strong hops, with an English character (floral, earthy, tea, or marmalade-like) are common.

      "aroma":"Rich, deep, complex, and often quite intense, with a pleasant blend of roast, fruit, hops, and alcohol. Light to moderately strong roast can have a coffee, bittersweet or dark chocolate, cocoa, black licorice, tar, or slightly burnt grain quality, sometimes with a light caramel sweetness or toasty maltiness. Low to moderately strong esters often perceived as dark or dried fruits like plums, prunes, figs, black currants, or raisins. Very low to fairly aggressive hops, often English or American in character. Alcohol flavor optional, but should not be sharp, hot, or solventy. The balance between these main four components can vary greatly; not all need to be noticeable, but those present should have a smooth interplay. Age can add another dimension, including a vinous or port-like impression, but not sourness. Age can decrease aroma intensity.",
      "appearance":"Color ranges from very dark reddish-brown to jet black. Opaque. Deep tan to dark brown head. Generally has a well-formed head, although head retention may be low to moderate. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible as legs.",
      "flavor":"Like the aroma, a complex mix of roast, fruit, hops, and alcohol (same descriptors apply). The flavors can be quite intense, often greater than in the aroma, but the same warning about the balance varying greatly still applies. Medium to aggressively high bitterness. The maltiness balances and supports the other flavors, and may have qualities of bread, toast, or caramel. The palate and finish can be fairly dry to moderately sweet, an impression that often changes with age. Should not by syrupy or cloying. Aftertaste of roast, bitterness, and warmth. Same age effects as in the aroma apply.",
      "mouthfeel":"Full to very full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture. The body and texture may decline with age. Gentle, smooth warmth should be present and noticeable, but as a background character. Low to moderate carbonation.",
      "comments":"Sometimes known as Russian Imperial Stout or RIS. Varying interpretations exist with American versions having greater bitterness, and more roasted character and late hops, while English varieties often reflect a more complex specialty malt character with a more forward ester profile. Not all Imperial Stouts have a clearly \u2018English\u2019 or \u2018American\u2019 character; anything in between is allowable as well, which is why it is counter-productive to define strict sub-types. Judges must be aware of the broad range of the style, and not try to judge all examples as clones of a specific commercial beer.",
      "history":"A style with a long, although not necessarily continuous, heritage. Traces roots to strong English porters brewed for export in the 1700s, and said to have been popular with the Russian Imperial Court. After the Napoleonic wars interrupted trade, these beers were increasingly sold in England. The style eventually all but died out, until being popularly embraced in the modern craft beer era in England as a revival export and in the United States as an adaptation by extending the style with American characteristics.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Pale malt with significant roasted malts or grain. Flaked adjuncts common. American or English ale yeast and hops are typical. Ages very well. Increasingly used as the base beer for many specialty styles.",

Those other IPAs should generally be entered in the 21B Specialty IPA style. An India Pale Lager (IPL) can be entered as an American IPA if it has a similar character, otherwise 34B Mixed-Style Beer. Oak is inappropriate in this style; if noticeably oaked, enter in 33A Wood-Aged Beer. Dry, sharply bitter, clear examples are sometimes known as West Coast IPA, which is really just a type of American IPA.",
      "history":"The first modern American craft beer adaptation of this traditional English style is generally believed to be Anchor Liberty Ale, first brewed in 1975 and using whole Cascade hops; the style has evolved beyond that original beer, which now tastes more like an American Pale Ale in comparison. American-made IPAs from earlier eras were not unknown (particularly the well-regarded Ballantine\u2019s IPA, an oak-aged beer using an old English recipe). This style is based on the modern craft beer examples.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Pale base malt. American or English yeast with a clean or slightly fruity profile. Generally all-malt, but sugar additions are acceptable. Restrained use of crystal malts. Often uses American or New World hops but any are varieties are acceptable; new hop varieties continue to be released and may be used even if they do not have the sensory profiles listed as examples.",
      "styleComparison":"Stronger and more highly hopped than American Pale Ale. Compared to English IPA, has less caramel, bread, and toast; often more American or New World hops; fewer yeast-derived esters; less body and often a more hoppy balance; and is slightly stronger than most examples. Less alcohol than a Double IPA, but with a similar balance.",

      "flavor":"High to very high hop flavor, same descriptors as aroma. Low to very low neutral malt character, subtle in the balance. No strong malt flavors, no caramel. Perceived bitterness is low to very low due to the bone-dry finish and very high carbonation. Neutral to slightly fruity fermentation profile. No diacetyl. Dry to very dry finish with a fresh, hoppy aftertaste, and a clean bitterness.",

      "comments":"Original concept was a sparkling wine-like IPA, although the hop character now varies more widely. Very low final gravity and high carbonation makes balance critical, often requiring a surprisingly low measured bitterness. \u2018Brut\u2019 is a wine term indicating dryness. Used incorrectly, added enzymes can cause diacetyl, which is always a flaw.",
      "history":"A modern craft beer style originating in 2017 at the (now closed) Social Kitchen & Brewery in San Francisco as a west coast reaction to the rising trend of east coast hazy and juicy IPAs as well as thick and sweet so-called milkshake IPAs. The style is still evolving and changing (and perhaps dying, as the beer was quite faddish in 2018-2019 in the US). Most versions seem to be morphing into low-calorie IPAs.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Pilsner or very pale base malts with up to 40% adjuncts. No crystal malt or lactose. Enzymes, such as amyloglucosidase. Highly aromatic, oil-heavy, modern American or New World hops used in a variety of late-hopping or post-boil procedures to emphasize hop aroma and flavor and to minimize bitterness. Neutral yeast.",

The opacity can add a \u2018shine\u2019 to the beer and make the color seem darker. Any visible floating hop matter, yeast clumps, or other particulates is a fault. Medium to rocky, meringue-like white head with high to very high retention.",

Alchemist Heady Topper is believed to be the original inspiration as the style grew in popularity during the 2010s. The style continues to evolve, including a trend towards lower bitterness and using the style as the base for other additions.",

Neutral to estery yeast. Balanced to chloride-rich water. Heavily dry-hopped, partly during active fermentation, using a variety of hopping doses and temperatures to emphasis depth of hop aroma and flavor over bitterness. Biotransformation of hop oils during fermentation adds to the depth and fruit complexity.",

Many modern American IPAs are fruity and somewhat hazy; examples with a dry, crisp finish, at most medium body, and high perceived bitterness should be entered as 21A American IPA.

      "history":"Traditionally the strongest ale offered by a brewery, often associated with the winter season and vintage-dated. As with many American craft beer styles, an adaptation of an English style using American ingredients and balance. One of the first American craft beer versions was Anchor Old Foghorn, first brewed in 1975. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, first brewed in 1983, set the standard for the hop-forward style of today. The story goes that when Sierra Nevada first sent Bigfoot out for lab analysis, the lab called and said, \u201cyour Barleywine is too bitter\u201d \u2013 to which Sierra Nevada replied, \u201cthank you.\u201d",

      "styleComparison":"Greater emphasis on hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma than English Barley Wine, often featuring American hop varieties. Typically paler than the darker English Barley Wines and lacking their deeper malt flavors, but darker than the golden English Barley Wines. Differs from a Double IPA in that the hops are not extreme, the malt is more forward, and the body is fuller and often richer. American Barleywine typically has more residual sweetness than Double IPA, which affects the overall drinkability (sipping vs. drinking).",

      "aroma":"A moderate to moderatelyHigh sharply sour character is dominant. Can have up to a moderately fruitiness, often lemon, tart apple, peach, or apricot, and a light floral note. No hop aroma. The wheat may be perceived as raw bread dough in fresher versions; style-id with the acidity, may suggest sourdough bread.",

      "history":"A regional specialty of Berlin. Referred to by Napoleon's troops in 1809 as \u201cthe Champagne of the North\u201d due to its lively and elegant character. At one point, it was smoked and there used to be M\u00e4rzen-strength (14 \u00b0P) version. Increasingly rare in Germany, but now produced in several other countries.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Pilsner malt. Usually wheat malt, often at least half the grist. A symbiotic co-fermentation with top-fermenting yeast and LAB provides the sharp sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during fermentation and by cool aging.

      "comments":"The \u201cwine-like\u201d observation should not be taken too literally; it may suggest a high-acid French Burgundy to some, but it is clearly not identical. Produced by long aging (up to two years) in large wooden vats (foeders), blending of young and well-aged beer, and variable amounts of sweetening of the final product. A wide range of products are possible depending on the actual blend and whether any sweetening takes place.

The funkiness can be moderate to strong, and can be described as barnyard, leather, earthy, goaty, hay, horsey, or horse blanket. Fruitiness is light to moderate, with a citrus fruit, citrus rind, pome fruit, or rhubarb quality. Malt is supportive, and can be lightly bready, grainy, honey, or wheat-like, if noticeable. Should not have enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy faults. No hops. Light oak acceptable. Complexity of aroma is valued more than intensity, but a balanced sour presentation is desirable.",
      "appearance":"Golden color, with excellent clarity and a thick, rocky, mousse-like, white head that seems to last forever. Effervescent.",
      "flavor":"Sour and funky on the palate, with a similar character as the aroma (same descriptors and intensities apply for funk and fruit). Low bready, grainy malt. Bitterness low to none; sourness provides most of the balance. No hop flavor. Crisp, dry finish, with a tart and funky aftertaste. Light oak, vanilla, and honey are acceptable. Should not have enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy faults. The beer should not be one dimensionally sour; a balanced, moderately sour presentation is classic, with the funky and fruity notes providing complexity. May be aged.",
      "mouthfeel":"Light to medium-light body; should not be watery. Has a low to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Some versions have a very light warming character. Highly carbonated.",
      "comments":"Blending young and aged lambic creates a more complex product, and often reflects the personal taste of the blender. A noticeable vinegary or cidery character is considered a fault by Belgian brewers. A good Gueuze is not the most pungent, but possesses a full and tantalizing bouquet, a sharp aroma, and a soft, velvety texture. Lambic is served uncarbonated, while Gueuze is served sparkling. Products marked oude or vieille (\u201cold\u201d) are considered most traditional.",
      "history":"Same basic history as Lambic, but involves blending, which may be performed outside the brewery. Some of the best examples are produced by blenders, who ferment, age, blend, and package the final product. Some modern producers are sweetening their products post-fermentation to make them more palatable to a wider audience. These guidelines describe the traditional dry product.",

      "flavor":"Combines the flavor profile of a Gueuze (same description applies) with noticeable flavor contributions from the added fruit. Traditional versions are dry and tart, with an added fermented fruit flavor. Modern versions may have a variable sweetness, which can offset the acidity. Fruit flavors also fade with age, and lose their vibrancy, so can be low to high in intensity.",
      "mouthfeel":"Light to medium-light body; should not be watery. Has a low to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Some versions have a light warming character. Carbonation can vary from sparkling to nearly still.",
      "comments":"Produced like Gueuze, with the fruit commonly added halfway through aging, so the yeast and bacteria can ferment all sugars from the fruit; or less commonly by adding fruit to a Lambic. The variety of fruit can sometimes be hard to identify since fermented and aged fruit is often perceived differently than the more recognizable fresh fruit. Fruit can bring acidity and tannins, in addition to flavor and aroma; understanding the fermented character of added fruit helps with judging the style.",

Light bready, doughy, yeasty character like uncooked sourdough bread. The acidity and coriander can give a bright, lively impression. The salt may be perceived as a very light, clean sea breeze character or just a general freshness, if noticeable at all.",

      "flavor":"Noticeable sourness, mediumLow to mediumHigh. Moderate bready or doughy malt flavor. Light to moderate fruity character of pome fruit, stone fruit, or lemons. Light to moderate salt character, up to the threshold of taste; the salt should be noticeable (particularly in the initial taste) but not taste overtly salty. Very low bitterness. No hop flavor. Dry, fully-attenuated finish, with acidity not hops balancing the malt. Acidity can be more noticeable in the finish, and enhance the refreshing quality of the beer. The acidity should be balanced, not forward (although historical versions could be very sour). No THP.",
      "mouthfeel":"High to very high carbonation. Effervescent. Medium-light to medium-full body. Salt may give a slightly tingly, mouthwatering quality and a rounder, thicker mouthfeel. Yeast and wheat can also add a little body, but shouldn\u2019t feel heavy due to the thinning effects of acidity.",
      "comments":"Historical versions may have been more sour than modern examples due to spontaneous fermentation, and may be blended with syrups as is done with Berliner Weisse, or with caraway liqueur. Modern examples are inoculated with Lacto, and are more balanced and generally don\u2019t need sweetening. Pronounced GOH-zeh.",
      "history":"Minor style associated with Leipzig but originating in the Middle Ages in the town of Goslar on the Gose River. Documented to have been in Leipzig by 1740. Leipzig was said to have 80 Gose houses in 1900. Production declined significantly after WWII, and ceased entirely in 1966. Modern production was revived in the 1980s in Germany, but the beer was not widely available. Became popular outside of Germany recently as a revival style, and is often used as a base style for fruited sour beers and other Specialty-Type beers.",

      "styleComparison":"Perceived acidity is not as intense as Berliner Weisse or Gueuze. Restrained use of salt, coriander, and Lacto \u2013 should not taste overtly salty. Coriander aroma can be similar to a Witbier. Haziness similar to a Weissbier.",

      "comments":"Historical versions may have had some lactic sourness but this is absent in fresh modern versions. Spicing has some variety, but should not be overdone. Coriander of certain origin or age might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer tends to be perishable, so younger, fresher, properly-handled examples are most desirable. An impression of sweetness is often due to low bitterness, not residual sugar. Most examples seem to be approximately 5% ABV.",
      "history":"One of a group of medieval Belgian white beers from the Leuven area, it died out in 1957 and was later revived in 1966 by Pierre Celis at what became Hoegaarden.

      "aroma":"Moderate bready malt aroma, which can include toasty, biscuity, or nutty notes, possibly with a touch of light caramel or honey. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness complements the malt, and is suggestive of pear, orange, apple, or lemon, and sometimes of darker stone fruit like plums. Low to moderate spicy, herbal, or floral hop character. Low peppery, spicy phenols optional. The hop character is lower in balance than the malt and fruitiness.",

Moderate to moderately high fruitiness, with a pear, orange, apple, or lemon character. MediumLow to low spicy, herbal, or floral hop character. MediumHigh to mediumLow bitterness, enhanced by optional low to very low peppery phenols. Dry to balanced finish, with hops becoming more pronounced in the aftertaste of those with a drier finish. Fairly well balanced overall, with no single component being high in intensity; malt and fruitiness are more forward initially with a supportive bitterness and drying character coming on late.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium to medium-light body. Smooth palate. Alcohol level is restrained, and any warming character should be low if present. Medium to mediumHigh carbonation.",
      "comments":"Most commonly found in the Flemish provinces of Antwerp, Brabant, Hainaut, and East Flanders. A Sp\u00e9ciale Belge Ale (Belgian Special Ale) in Belgium.",

      "comments":"Cellar, musty, moldy, or rustic character often mentioned in literature are signs of mishandled imports, not fresh, authentic products. Age and oxidation can also increase fruitiness and caramel flavors, but increase harshness. While caramel and fruit can be part of the style, do not confuse the oxidation character for the proper base beer.",
      "history":"Name roughly means beer for keeping. A traditional farmhouse artisanal ale from the area around Lille in Northern France, historically brewed in early spring and kept in cold cellars for consumption in warmer weather. Although documented to exist in the 1800s, Jenlain is the prototypical modern amber lager version first bottled in the 1940s.",

Medium bitterness, with the malt slightly more prominent in the balance. Moderate to low yeast profile with orange or lemon esters, and slight spicy-peppery phenols. Can have a light perfumy character. Light hop flavor, can be spicy or earthy, complementing yeast. Finishes medium-dry to dry, smooth, and soft, with light alcohol and malt in the aftertaste.",
      "mouthfeel":"MediumHigh to high carbonation, can give mouth-filling bubbly sensation. Medium body. Light to moderate alcohol warmth, but smooth. Can be somewhat creamy.",
      "comments":"Most commercial examples are in the 6.5 \u2013 7% ABV range. Often has an almost lager-like character, which gives it a cleaner profile in comparison to many other Belgian styles. Flemish-speaking Belgians use the term Blond, while the French speakers spell it Blonde. Many monastic or artisanal Belgian beers are called Blond but those are not representative of this style.",
      "history":"Relatively recent development to further appeal to European Pils drinkers, becoming more popular as it is heavily marketed and widely distributed. Despite claims of links back to 1200, the beer style was created after World War II and first popularized by Leffe.",

      "aroma":"A complex bouquet of fruity esters, herbal hops, and peppery alcohol over a nearly neutral malt base. The esters are moderate to high, often pome fruit, especially pear. Hops are herbal, floral, or spicy, low to moderate. Alcohol and phenols often have a peppery or perfumy quality, low to moderate. Alcohol perception should be soft, not hot or solventy.

Low to mediumLow malt backdrop, with bready, crackery, grainy, or light honey notes. Fruit expression can vary widely (apple, pear, grapefruit, lemon, orange, peach, apricot).

Moderate spicy or floral hop flavor on the palate. Moderate esters similar in character to aroma. Light to moderate spicy phenols as found in the aroma. Medium to high bitterness, accentuated by dryness. The yeast and hop character lasts into the aftertaste.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium-light to medium body. Smooth. MediumHigh to high carbonation, can be somewhat prickly. Should not have noticeable alcohol warmth.",
      "comments":"Often not labeled or available outside the monastery, or infrequently brewed. Might also be called monk\u2019s beer, Brother\u2019s beer, or simply a Blond (we don\u2019t use this term to avoid confusion with the very different Belgian Blond Ale style). Highly attenuated, generally 85% or more.",
      "history":"While monastic breweries have a tradition of brewing a lower-strength beer as a monk\u2019s daily ration (Westmalle began making theirs in 1922), the bitter, pale beer this style describes is a relatively modern invention reflecting current tastes. Westvleteren first brewed theirs in 1999, but it replaced older lower-gravity products.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Pilsner malt. Belgian yeast. Continental hops.",
      "styleComparison":"Like a top-fermented Belgian interpretation of a German Pils \u2013 pale, hoppy, and well-attenuated, but with a strong Belgian yeast character. Has less sweetness, higher attenuation, less character malt, and is more hop-centered than a Belgian Pale Ale. More like a much smaller, more highly-hopped Belgian Tripel (with its bitterness and dryness) than a smaller Belgian Blond Ale.",

Moderate bitterness in the aftertaste with substantial spicy-fruity yeast character. Should not be sweet.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the substantial gravity would suggest. Highly carbonated. The alcohol content is deceptive, and has little to no obvious warming sensation. Effervescent. Should not be heavy.",
      "comments":"High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and attenuation helps bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. Most traditional versions have at least 30 IBUs and are very dry.",
      "history":"Popularized by the monastery at Westmalle, first brewed in 1934.",

The malt character is moderatelyHigh to high and has a deep, bready-toasty base with dark caramel notes, but no impression of dark or roasted malt. Esters are strong to moderately low, and reminiscent of raisins, plums, dried cherries, figs, dates, or prunes. Spicy phenols like black pepper or vanilla, not clove, may be present as a low to moderate background character. A soft, spicy, perfumy, or rose-like alcohol is low to moderate, but never hot or solvent-like. Hops are usually not noticeable, but if present can add a light spicy, floral, or herbal character.",
      "appearance":"Deep amber to deep coppery-brown in color (dark in the style name implies more deeply colored than golden, not black). Huge, dense, moussy, persistent cream- to light tan-colored head. Usually clear.",
      "flavor":"Rich and complex maltiness, but not heavy in the finish. The flavor character is similar to the aroma (same malt, ester, phenol, alcohol, and hop comments apply here as well). Moderately malty-rich on the palate, which can have a sweet impression if bitterness is low. Usually moderately dry to dry finish, although may be up to moderately sweet. MediumLow to moderate bitterness; alcohol provides some of the balance to the malt. Generally malty-rich balance, but can be fairly even with bitterness. The complex and varied flavors should blend smoothly and harmoniously, and often benefit from age. The finish should not be heavy or syrupy.",
      "mouthfeel":"High carbonation but not sharp. Smooth but noticeable alcohol warmth. Body can range from medium-light to medium-full and creamy. Most are medium-bodied.",
      "comments":"Also known as a Belgian Quad, mainly outside of Belgium (Quadruple is the name of a specific beer). Has a wider range of interpretation than many other Belgian styles. Traditional versions tend to be drier than many modern commercial versions, which can be rather sweet and full-bodied. Many examples are simply known by their strength or color designation. Some might be labeled Grand Cru, but this is more of a statement of quality than style.",
      "history":"Westvleteren started making their version just before World War II, with Chimay and Rochefort adding their examples just after. Other monastic breweries created products towards the end of the 20th century, but some secular breweries began producing similar beers starting around 1960.",

Judge these somewhat like Specialty-Type Beers; consider the range of kellerbiers based on Helles to M\u00e4rzen to Dunkel to be a continuous spectrum, so allow the brewer to pick the closest one without being too picky about strict adherence to the base style.",
      "history":"Originally referred to lager beer matured in the caves or cellars under the brewery, and then served from them. First applied to amber lager from Franconia, then later to local Munich styles. More recently used internationally to create specialty Pils variants. By tradition, a serving style for a popular summer specialty in Bavaria, but now adapted broadly as a marketing term for unfiltered lagers.",
      "characteristicIngredients":"Same as base styles. Traditionally naturally carbonated. Dry-hopping is not a traditional German brewing method, but some modern pale examples use this technique \u2013 which is allowable in this style as long as it is balanced.

Medium to low bitterness, no coarse or harsh aftertaste. May exhibit light fruitiness. Balance in the finish is towards the malt, possibly with a lightly flinty or minerally-sulfate flavor. The finish is fairly dry. No sourness.",
      "mouthfeel":"Medium to medium-light body with a relatively soft mouthfeel. Highly carbonated. Can have a creamy texture.",
      "comments":"Modern accounts of the style often mention lactic sourness or sour mashing, but brewing records from around 1900 at larger breweries have no indication of long acid rests, sour mashing, or extensive aging. These stories are likely modern homebrewer inventions, theorizing that since local Bourbon distillers used a sour mash, beer brewers must also done so. No records indicate sour mashing or even a sour profile in the beer; rather the opposite, that it was brewed as an inexpensive, present-use ale. Enter soured versions in 28B Mixed-Fermentation Sour Beer.",
      "history":"An American original, Kentucky Common was almost exclusively produced and sold around Louisville, Kentucky from some time after the Civil War until Prohibition. It was inexpensive and quickly produced, racked into barrels while actively fermenting, and tightly bunged to allow carbonation in the saloon cellar. Before the style died, it accounted for about 75% of sales around Louisville.",

      "styleComparison":"Like a darker-colored Cream Ale emphasizing corn, but with some light character malt flavor. Malt flavors and balance are probably closest to modern adjunct-driven International Amber or Dark Lagers, Irish Red Ales, or Belgian Pale Ales.",

      "aroma":"Low to moderate oak wood smoke is the most prominent aroma component, but can be subtle and hard to detect. A low spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma is typically present, and should be lower than or equal to the smoke in intensity. Hints of grainy wheat are also detected in the best examples. The aroma is otherwise clean, although light pome fruit esters (especially ripe red apple or pear) are welcome. No acidity. Light sulfur optional.",
      "appearance":"Pale yellow to gold in color with excellent clarity. A tall, billowy, white, tightly-knit head with excellent retention is distinctive. Murkiness is a fault.",
      "flavor":"ModeratelyLow to medium oak smoke flavor up front which carries into the finish; the smoke can be stronger in flavor than in aroma. The smoke character is gentle, should not be acrid, and can lend an impression of sweetness. A moderate to strong bitterness is readily evident which lingers through the finish. The overall balance is toward bitterness. Low but perceptible spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor. Low grainy wheat character in the background. Light pome fruit esters (red apple or pear) may be present. Dry, crisp finish. No sourness.",

Its fame and popularity rapidly extended to other parts of the world in the late 19th and early 20th century. Regular commercial production declined after WWII and ceased in the 1990s. This style description describes the traditional version during its period of greatest popularity.",

Traditional Polish, Czech or German hops. Moderate hardness sulfate water. Clean, attenuative ale yeast; Weizen yeast inappropriate.",
      "styleComparison":"Similar in strength to a Berliner Weisse, but never sour and much more bitter. Has a smoked character but less intense than in a Rauchbier. Lower gravity than a Lichtenhainer, but more bitter and not sour. More bitter than a Gose, but no salt and spices.",

The wild character can be prominent, but does not need to be dominating in a style with an otherwise strong malt or hop profile.

Banana, bubblegum, and the like are considered faults.",

These darker colors may also come from using cooked or concentrated grape products, never from specialty dark grains. White to reddish head with generally a mediumLow retention. Clarity is generally good. Never hazy.",

Fruit flavors (stone, tropical, berries, etc.) as appropriate for the variety of grape. Darker red grapes can contribute more rustic flavors (e.g., earthy, tobacco, leather). The malt character is supportive, not robust and usually of the pale, lightly kilned varieties. Very low levels of pale crystal malts are allowed but roasted or strong chocolate character is always inappropriate. Bitterness is generally low and hop flavors can be low to non-existent. Mild tart notes, due to variety and amount of grape used, is common and may help to improve the digestibility but should not near \u2018sour\u2019 threshold. Complementary oak is optional but a funky Brett character should not be present. Clean fermentation.",

Beechwood, or other hardwood (e.g., oak, maple, mesquite, alder, pecan, apple, cherry, other fruitwoods) smoked malts may be used. These may be reminiscent of certain smoked foods (e.g., hickory with ribs, maple with bacon or sausage, and alder with salmon). Evergreen wood should never be used since it adds a medicinal, piney flavor to the malt. Noticeable peat-smoked malt is universally undesirable due to its sharp, piercing phenols and dirt-like earthiness. The remaining ingredients vary with the base style.

      "aroma":"Varies with base style. A low to moderate woody aroma is usually present; some varietals may have a stronger, or distinctive character. If the wood is toasted or charred, there may be low to moderate vanilla, caramel, toffee, toast, or cocoa character present. Aromatics associated with alcohol (e.g., distilled spirits, wine) previously stored in the wood should be noticeable, but balanced.",
      "appearance":"Varies with base style. Often darker than the unadulterated base beer style, particularly if charred barrels are used. Beers aged in wine barrels or other products with distinctive colors may also impart a color to the finished beer.",
      "flavor":"Varies with base style. Wood usually contributes a woody flavor, and possibly a distinctive varietal character. Toasted or charred wood can add vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, toasted bread, toasted nuts, coffee, chocolate, or cocoa, depending on the wood varietal and level of toast or char. Wood-derived flavors and added alcohol flavors should be balanced, mutually supportive, and noticeable, while not overpowering the base beer style or each other.",
      "mouthfeel":"Varies with base style. Tannins from the wood may increase the perception of body, as well as enhancing the dryness of the finish; some astringency from wood tannins is allowable. Usually exhibits additional alcohol warming, but should not be hot or harsh. Tart or acidic characteristics should be low to none, and never distracting.",
      "comments":"Success in this style depends on how well the wood and alcohol character supports and enhances the base beer, and how well integrated they are with the overall flavor profile. Age character is allowable, but excessive oxidation or sourness is a fault.",

      "characteristicIngredients":"Varies with base style. Aged in wooden casks or barrels previously used to store alcohol (e.g., whiskey, bourbon, rum, gin, tequila, port, sherry, Madeira, wine).
